# Lab 5: Configure Auto Scaling

## Overview

The autoscale feature lets you scale your AVD Host Pools up or down to optimize deployment costs. Based on your needs, you can make a scaling plan based on time of day, specific days of the week, and session limits per session host. In this lab, you'll be configuring auto-scaling of the AVD host pool in your NMM Account. 

## Exercise 1: Configure Auto Scaling

In this exercise, We'll be configuring auto-scaling of an existing AVD Host Pool in your NMM Account.
