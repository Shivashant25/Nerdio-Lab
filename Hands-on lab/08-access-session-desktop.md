# Lab 8: Access the Desktop using AVD Desktop Client

## Overview

Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) integrates virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and the cloud. AVD is Microsoft Azureâ€™s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It enables small to large cloud consumers to provide remote applications and full desktops from Microsoft cloud to their end-users. Azure Files is also a  platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for AVD users. In this lab, you'll be accessing the Desktop using the AVD Desktop Client and verifying the User profiles stored in the File share
